# Geometric Fractal Using Turtle Module

This was just a fun, simple project I made while messing around. 

I wrote functions for a turtle to draw each of the basic shapes from triangles up to dodecagons (all equilateral). 

Then I wrote a function to draw all these shapes, rotate 90 degrees, then redraw them with the new orientation.

I made it draw 4 sets of 12 shapes in a group with a common origin, then move forward, and repeat the whole preceeding steps in a larger group of 4. 

The program was elegantly reduced to a small for loop composed of a calling function and forward method.
