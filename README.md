# Geometric Fractal Using Turtle Module

This was just a fun simple project I made while messing around. 
I wrote a function for a turtle to draw each of the basic shapes from triangles up to dodecagons (all equilateral). 
I wrote a function to draw all these shapes, then rotate 90 degrees, then redraw at the new location.
I made it draw the 4 sets of 12 shapes in a group, then rotate 90 degrees, move forward and repeat the whole preceeding steps in a larger group of 4. 
The program was elegantly reduced to a single function composed of other functions.
